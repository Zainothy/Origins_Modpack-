This is the Origins modpack that I created, it adds a nice overhaul whilst still staying relatively vanilla, and (of course) has the Origins Mod & Extra Origins. It includes content mods like: 

- BetterEnd 
- Biome Makeover 
- Enchanting Infuser 

This Modpack is based off of [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), In terms of optimizations. 

I have also included nice looking visual tweaks (e.g Falling Leaves), client tweaks and nice shaders. All the Shader Creators have been credited in the Github and below.

# FAQ:
### I get a java error when trying to launch the game in Prism:
Enable skip  java compatibility checks in Prism Launcher>Settings> Java 

### Java isn't working properly/ I don't have it installed: 
Please install the jatest version of Java 20/ Java 17 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) 

### My FPS is terrible: 
This is likely caused by LambDynamic Lights: 
Go in the mod Config and set "Dynamic Lights" to fastest if you want to use dynamic lights, if you don't care: set it to off
(If you are using complementary shaders, or any shaders with dynamic lights: You don't need lambdynamiclights enabled)

## Where is The modpack: 
Found in the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/simpleorigins/) or the releases page of this github

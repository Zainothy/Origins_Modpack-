# Origins Modpack
This is the Origins modpack that I created for my Friends SMP, it adds a nice overhaul whilst still staying True to the Original Game, and (of course) has the Origins Mod & Extra Origins

# Setup Guide 

- Download [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org)

- select the zip/.mrpack file for the modpack 
- if it asks you to download some files whilst it installs, put them in your downloads folder. Prism will find it 
- You can now launch the instance and connect to the server

### Java isn't working properly/ I don't have it installed: 
Please install the jatest version of Java 20/ Java 17 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) 

### My FPS is terrible: 
This is likely caused by LambDynamic Lights: 
Go in the mod Config and set "Dynamic Lights" to fastest if you want to use dynamic lights, if you don't care: set it to off
(If you are using complementary shaders, or any shaders with dynamic lights: You don't need lambdynamiclights enabled)
